# Sensor Block PCBs

The PCBs for blocks that require circuit boards are linked to here.

Many blocks can be (and are currently) made without a circuit board,
using fly wires to connect the required sensors directly to the Arduino
board's header pin through holes.

TODO: include a representative image here

Blocks using only a combination of the following (non-exhaustive) list of
sensors, which can easily be read directly by the Arduino little to no
supporting circuitry (e.g. a single resistor), are currently manufactured
using fly wire:

- rotary encoders
- potentiometers (slide or rotary)
- piezo discs
- switches (arcade, mechanical, etc)
- hall effect sensors
- joy sticks
- force sensitive resistors
- I2C-based modules already available on breakout boards
- etc.
